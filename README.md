## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

   [I used some Stack Overflow to get help on importing images and creating a randomized array in JS, got the images
   from Google Search and the font from Google Fonts.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

   [I was struggling with setting the button to be an image and making it fit so I had to read up on some CSS attributes like 'background',
   'background-image' and 'background-size'. Eventually I figured it out. I also struggled getting to renadomize the array until
   I read more about Math.random. I then had some issues adding more buttons but proceeded to carefully make sure I updated the rest
   of the code to adapt to that change. At some point my three strikes implementation was breaking the functionality but that turned
   out to be simple syntax mistakes.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   [I am lucky enough to already have some basic experience with these tools, including Glitch, which made the whole process faster and simpler.
   However, this was a very fun project to do, I learned something about every language I used and reminded me once more how honestly fun
   these type of projects can be. I ended up being hooked on making it 'Adventure Time' themed and more appealing, as well as smarter. This makes me eager
   to continue to learn about these languages, continue to develop and understand more projects like this.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

   [I would try to do sound clips for every character instead of generic sound, make the whole website more thematic and provide some fun
   feedback, perhaps even use this to make a different, more elaborate program, like a choose your own adventure game or a platformer.]
